        <p>
          My name is Alex. I graduated from computer science last year. now I am working on an Industrial Internet company which is different from traditinal IT company. Literally obsessed with coding & technology, overall.
          My knowledge in general is deep but, I have only been coding for a few years. Also I very love linux, especially <b>Arch Linux</b> distro.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          I am now studying MIT's julia by some OS projects.
          Also, I am looking for some great idea for my side projects.
          So if you have an idea and are looking for someone to work with, don't hesitate to contact me.
